## Welcome to the Public Skydel Plug-ins Github repository!

With plug-ins, users can develop features and integrate them to the Skydel user interface and the real-time simulation engine. In Skydel's context, a plug-in is a dynamic library (*.so* on Ubuntu and *.dll* on Windows).

This repository contains the Skydel Plug-ins Software Development Kit (SDK) and multiple plug-in examples.

See [documentation](https://skydel.gitbook.io/skydel-plug-ins-documentation/) to have more details on how to get started.
